# Bite-O-Meter: Nail Biter Analyzer

## Overview
An AI-powered app that determines whether fingernails are bite-worthy and assigns a Biting Satisfaction Score (0â€“10).

## Inspiration
Based on the Appam Kuzhi Counter project, but applied to human nails for maximum absurdity.

## Features
- Finger detection and scoring
- Bite-o-Meter gauge
- Finger ranking leaderboard
- Hall of Fame & Hall of Shame
- Social sharing and user personas

## Tech Stack
- **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, MediaPipe, OpenCV** for AI model and finger detection
- **TensorFlow.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the web app
- **Firebase** for leaderboard and Hall of Fame
- **Chart.js and HTML Canvas** for visualizations and shareable memes

## Roadmap
1. Dataset collection and augmentation
2. Model training and export to TensorFlow.js
3. Finger detection pipeline using MediaPipe
4. Web app integration with Bite-o-Meter and leaderboard
5. Humor features (Personas, Hall of Fame, Fake Scientific Terms)
6. Social sharing of results

## Future Scope
- Toe Edition
- Multi-Bite Optimization
- Smartwatch alerts for real-time bite recommendations
